Instructions
The instructions for this activity are broken into two parts:

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualisation

The first task was to visualise an earthquake dataset. Complete the following steps:

#To do so, follow these steps:

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visited the USGS GeoJSON FeedLinks to an external site. page and chose a dataset to visualise( "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days").

Using Leaflet, created a map that plots all the earthquakes from dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by colour. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appears larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appears darker in colour.
